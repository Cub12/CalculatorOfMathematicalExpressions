You can enter parameters in two ways:
  First and the best: Enter each parameter in double quotes, with one or more spaces between the quotes.
    Example: "1 + a * 2" "a = 2"
    In this case, you can put spaces inside the quotation marks: "1+ a *2" "a =  2"
  Second: You can not use quotes and separate parameters with one or more spaces.
    Example: 1+a*2 a=2
    
You can enter fractional numbers separated by a comma or a point: "1,2 + 3.5 * b" "b = 2,333"
You can write variable names in both uppercase and lowercase letters. So B is equal to b: "5 * B" "b=2"

You can name variables with any combination of letters without using numbers or other symbols.
  Example: вася^2 "вася = 3"
  
You can use parentheses to change the priority of operations.

You can put unary minus in front of variables: "-a" "a = 1"
  Such inputs will also be valid: "a + (-b)" "a = 3" "b=4" or a+-b a=3 b=4
  
Functions should be entered as follows:
  "tan(1)" or "tan (1)" - the name of the function, then the argument in parentheses with possible spaces after the name.
You can call variables by function names: tan(tan) tan=1
